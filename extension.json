# The following environment variables will be set: 
# IMAGE_NAME: The name of the image used as input 
# IP_LIMIT: The max allowed public IP addresses for this space 
# CONTAINER_NAME: The name parameter exposed on this job
# DEPLOY_TYPE: Input into the deployment strategy desired.  For example: simple, red_black
# PORT: Ports to expose on the container or the group
# The following colors have been defined to help with presentation of logs: green, red, label_color, no_color.
